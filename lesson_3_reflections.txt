When would you want to use a remote repository 
rather than keeping all your work local?

I can think of several reasons why you would want to use a remote
repository:
- to share your files with other people
- to allow other people to edit your files
- to share work on a project
- to allow access to files from multiple computers and locations


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It is helpful to consider changes made by other users at this stage
They may have made changes to the files that you do not want
Or may have made changes that are incomplete and will not make sense
These problems are unique to GitHub, since changes on the local machine
are likely made by the repository owner.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

A fork would only be used on GitHub, not on a local repository.
It is similar to clone, and will create a copy of a repository
under your own login.
A clone will make a copy of a repository, either from GitHub or
the local machine, including the history of revisions.
A branch will create a copy of certain changes within a
repository since a given time.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state 
of the remote stored locally?

Having a local and remote repository means that the two 
versions can become out of sync.
It is benefical to know the state of the remote repository
so that the differences between local and remote copies can
be identified.
It is then evident when the local changes should be pushed
to GitHub.
