When would you want to use a remote repository 
rather than keeping all your work local?

I can think of several reasons why you would want to use a remote
repository:
- to share your files with other people
- to allow other people to edit your files
- to share work on a project
- to allow access to files from multiple computers and locations


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It is helpful to consider changes made by other users at this stage
They may have made changes to the files that you do not want
Or may have made changes that are incomplete and will not make sense
These problems are unique to GitHub, since changes on the local machine
are likely made by the repository owner.
