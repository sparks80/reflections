What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

This creates a new folder called .git
This is required to store the information about changes to files as learnt in lesson 1.
Without this commits, file differences and checkouts (returning to previous versions) would be impossible.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is critical for adding multiple files to the same commit.
Choosing the files to group together is a useful feature, that allows a great degree of flexibility.
The repository is where the file information is stored once committed.
The working directory houses a set of files from a given commit.
It is like a buffer where information can be temporarily stored without making any permenent changes.
